	Originally posted: March 28, 2018

	Purpose: Reads a list of computer information with tab-separated
	details and pre-creates computer records in Jamf Pro. This enables
	a Jamf Pro admin to pre-assign sites or static groups before
	deploying devices.
	
	Instructions: Edit the associated tab-delimited file "Precreate
	Jamf Computer Record List.txt" and with serial number, MAC address
	and Site names. (Site names must already exist in Jamf Pro.) You
	may need to use a plain text editor such as BBEdit to ensure the
	.txt file is saved with UNIX line endings (LF).
	
	This script creates a log file in the same directory as the script.
