#
# Purpose: Downloads each network segment from your Jamf Pro server and
# saves it as an XML file in the JSS_Output directory. When used with
# UploadNetworkSegments.sh, a Jamf Pro administrator can start with a list
# from an old Jamf Pro server, delete unwanted network segment files and
# then upload the remaining files to another Jamf Pro server.
#
# The script creates a log file in the same folder as the script.

# INSTRUCTIONS

# 1) Modify URL, userName and passWord below to access your source Jamf Pro server.
# 2) Save and run this script via Terminal or an editor with a "run script" feature.
# 3) Review the XML files in the JSS_Output folder and Trash any you do not wish to upload to your destination Jamf Pro server.
# 4) Run the UploadNetworkSegments.sh script to populate your destination Jamf Pro server.
