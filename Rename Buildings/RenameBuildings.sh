# Purpose: Reads a tab-delimited file (requires UNIX line-endings)
# to get the name of a building in a Jamf Pro server and rename it. This
# lets an administrator rename inconsistently named buildings to a consistent
# format. Because buildings are referenced in other parts of the Jamf Pro
# server by ID rather than name, renaming buildings does not affect existing
# functionality.
#
# The script creates a log file in the same folder as the script.

# INSTRUCTIONS

# 1) Modify URL, userName and passWord below to access your Jamf Pro server.
# 2) Edit the RenameBuildingsList.tab file.
#	 One set of names per line in the format:
#	 Old building name _tab_ New building name
#	 Use a quality text editor such as BBEdit or TextWranlger to save the file with Unix line endings.
# 3) Place the RenameBuildingsList.tab file in the same directory as this script.
# 4) Run this script via Terminal or an editor with a "run script" feature.
# 5) Verify buildings in your Jamf Pro server.
