Jamf Scripts
bill@talkingmoose.net


Purpose

These are a random set of scripts I've made for customers to work with Jamf Pro. They are some examples for accessing a Jamf Pro server to download, upload or modify data as well as other functions.


Support

Jamf does not support these scripts. Please do not contact them for assistance. Contact Jamf if you need a custom script tailored to your environment.

For basic Jamf Pro Classic API documentation, use a web browser to access the API page on your server at:
https://server.yourdomain.com:8443/api or
https://yourinstance.jamfcloud.com/api
